I went on a digital adventure to showcase the beauty of Sicily in my Travel Project. 
I made this project during a 2-week SheCodes workshop that focused on making websites look great on all kinds of devices.
I harnessed the power of Google APIs to seamlessly integrate Google Maps and embedded YouTube videos into my project. 
These interactive elements serve as windows to the captivating landscapes and stories that Sicily unfolds, 
allowing users to immerse themselves in its beauty and culture without leaving the comfort of their screens.
